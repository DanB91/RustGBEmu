The goal of this project is to create a Game Boy emulator in Rust.  Right now it only displays CPU debug information.
It is compiled with the Rust 1.0 beta.

To run:
cargo run <path to Game Boy ROM>

Currently, you can just step through each CPU instruction in the ROM by hitting enter. 
Not all CPU opcodes are implemented yet.


To run unit tests:
cargo test
