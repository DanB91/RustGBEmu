The goal of this project is to create a Game Boy emulator in Rust.  
It is compiled with the Rust 1.1 beta.

To run:
cargo run <path to Game Boy ROM>

Native dependences (you must manually install):
    -SDL2
    -SDL2_TTF

All rust dependencies will automatically be downloaded by cargo.
Tested on OS X and Linux.

Right now it only displays a blank white screen with CPU debug information on top of it.  
Debug information can be toggled on and off with "D".


To run unit tests:
cargo test
